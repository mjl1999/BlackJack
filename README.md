# BlackJack
My attempt at coding blackjack in python

While not as concise as it could be (something I will revisit later on) I am happy with the level of functionality I was able to add - especially insofar as the computer being able to behave differently depending on the current state of the user's hand (i.e. if the user is bust, if the user has not gone bust and has a higher score, or if the user has a lower score and the computer has not gone bust).
