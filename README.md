# BlackJack
My attempt python blackjack program.
I very much have a love-hate relationship with this one!!!

Positives first.
This was the first project i ever completed without being given any direction on how to solve it or being given the first lines of code as a starting block. Because of that, I am quite fond of this project, as it was the first project where I can honestly say every line of code was something that came from me and my thought process. The night I started the project I was utterly convinced I would fail, but ended up managing to complete it in the same night, after about two or three breaks (and working into the early hours of the morning). It was the first time I <i>felt</i> like a programmer (see what I did there? :D )

On the other hand, I look at this project the same way I look at my old University Masters Thesis - I am ultimately proud of the completed project, but every time I look at it, I can't help but recall the sheer amount of head-scratching and fatigue it required to complete. In fact, following this project, I had burnout for about two days and no doubt many brain cells were lost in the making of it. In that sense, I guess i got to feel like a programmer in more ways than one.

While not as concise as it could be (something I will revisit later on) I am happy with the level of functionality I was able to add - especially insofar as the computer being able to behave differently depending on the current state of the user's hand (i.e. if the user is bust, if the user has not gone bust and has a higher score, or if the user has a lower score and the computer has not gone bust).
